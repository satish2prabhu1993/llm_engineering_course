       "**Code Explanation**\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "yield from {\n",
       "  book.get(\"author\") \n",
       "  for book in books \n",
       "  if book.get(\"author\")\n",
       "}\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "This is a generator expression, which means it generates a sequence of values that are yielded one at a time, rather than computing them all at once and returning them in a list.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Here's what each part does:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* `yield from {...}`: This is the outer syntax for a `yield` expression. It delegates the iteration over an inner iterable to another sequence.\n",
       "* `{book.get(\"author\") ...}`: Inside these curly brackets, we have an iterator that yields values.\n",
       "\t+ `book.get(\"author\"`: For each item in the `books` iterator, this line tries to get the value of the \"author\" key from the `book` dictionary and assigns it to our variable. If the key doesn't exist in the book's dictionary (i.e., `key does not exist` error), a default value like `None` can be returned using `.get()`.\n",
       "\t+ The trailing parentheses `{}` are used to enclose the inner iterable and specify that this is actually a dictionary comprehension.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How it works:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. The outer `yield from {...}` starts by iterating over an iterator (in this case, possibly another list comprehension or list of results).\n",
       "2. For each result in that iterator...\n",
       "   3. `book.get(\"author\")` tries to get the value associated with \"author\" for the current item `book`. This will yield that value as the next result.\n",
       "4. If any books do not exist (i.e., if book has no \"author\"), a default value is used - in this case, `None`.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example**\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "books = [\n",
       "  {\"title\": \"The great gatsby\", \"author\": \"Fitzgerald\"},\n",
       "  {\"title\": \"To Kill a mockingbird\", \"author\": None}, # Note that there's no 'author' here\n",
       "  {\"title\": \"1984\", \"author\": \"Orwell\"}\n",
       "]\n",
       "data = yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "print(data)  # Outputs: ['Fitzgerald', None, 'Orwell']\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "In this exampe `None` is printed because it's the author value associated with `\"title\": \"To Kill a mockingbird\"`."
